						👑 Benjamin Nguyen 👑
						<p>
							My name is Benjamin, and I am a computer science student at North
							Seattle College. It was fun working on this project, especially
							when it comes to a serious global problem about climate change.
							Through this project, I have learned that the majority of
							pollutants that make their way into the ocean come from human
							activities along the coastlines and far island. Besides, I also
							learned ways to prevent ocean pollution and together creating a
							better environment.

						👑 Connor C-M 👑
						<p>
							My name is Connor, I was born in Australia but raised here in
							Seattle. I am attending the Computing For All eight week summer
							course. This was an interesting project, and I learned a lot while
							designing and coding this website. It was a challenge at first but
							it got easier as I got a handle on the basics of coding and
							acquired a more developed view on web-design.
