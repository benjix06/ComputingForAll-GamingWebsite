							On July 8, NASA‚Äôs ECOSTRESS instrument, attached to the
							International Space Station, captured ground surface temperature
							data over California. In the image (middle image), areas in red ‚Äì
							including Death Valley ‚Äì had surpassed 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30
							degrees Celsius) by 7 a.m. local time, well above average ground
							surface temperatures for the area. <br /><br />On July 9, Death
							Valley recorded a high air temperature of 130 F, which fell just a
							few degrees short of the official all-time surface air temperature
							record of 134 F set in 1913. On July 11, Bishop, California, hit
							an all-time high of 111 F and Stovepipe Wells, California, set a
							new record for daily average temperature with 118 F. Numerous
							other daily, monthly, and all-time records were set throughout the
							inland areas of central and Southern California and northern
							Arizona.

							In some regions, rivers and lakes are so polluted that they are
							literally catching fire. Prime examples include the Bellandur Lake
							in Bangalore, India, which has carried ash onto buildings up to
							six miles away. <br /><br />The report estimates that the world is
							losing enough food to feed 170 million people each year ‚Äì the
							equivalent of the population of Bangladesh ‚Äì due to increase
							salinity, or salt content. <br /><br />
							The report recommends a set of actions that countries can take to
							improve water quality, including improving environmental policies
							and standards; accurate monitoring of pollution levels; effective
							enforcement systems; water treatment infrastructure supported with
							incentives for private investment; and reliable, accurate
							information disclosure to households to inspire greater civic
							engagement.

							Since the Industrial Revolution, the global annual temperature has
							increased in total by a little more than 1 degree Celsius, or
							about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Between 1880‚Äîthe year that accurate
							recordkeeping began‚Äîand 1980, it rose on average by 0.07 degrees
							Celsius (0.13 degrees Fahrenheit) every 10 years. Since 1981,
							however, the rate of increase has more than doubled: For the last
							40 years, we‚Äôve seen the global annual temperature rise by 0.18
							degrees Celsius, or 0.32 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade.
							<br /><br />
							The result? A planet that has never been hotter. Nine of the 10
							warmest years since 1880 have occurred since 2005‚Äîand the 5
							warmest years on record have all occurred since 2015. Climate
							change deniers have argued that there has been a ‚Äúpause‚Äù or a
							‚Äúslowdown‚Äù in rising global temperatures, but numerous studies,
							including a 2018 paper published in the journal Environmental
							Research Letters, have disproved this claim. The impacts of global
							warming are already harming people around the world.

							Climate change can impact air quality and, conversely, air quality
							can impact climate change. <br /><br />

							Changes in climate can result in impacts to local air quality.
							Atmospheric warming associated with climate change has the
							potential to increase ground-level ozone in many regions, which
							may present challenges for compliance with the ozone standards in
							the future. The impact of climate change on other air pollutants,
							such as particulate matter, is less certain, but research is
							underway to address these uncertainties. <br /><br />

							Emissions of pollutants into the air can result in changes to the
							climate. Ozone in the atmosphere warms the climate, while
							different components of particulate matter (PM) can have either
							warming or cooling effects on the climate. For example, black
							carbon, a particulate pollutant from combustion, contributes to
							the warming of the Earth, while particulate sulfates cool the
							earth's atmosphere.

							Fracking is a controversial form of drilling that uses
							high-pressure liquid to create cracks in underground shale to
							extract natural gas and petroleum. Carbon emissions from fossils
							fuels like these have been linked to global warming and climate
							change.

						<h1>Climate</h1>
						<p>
							Climate is the long-term pattern of weather in a particular area.
							Weather can change from hour-to-hour, day-to-day, month-to-month
							or even year-to-year. A region‚Äôs weather patterns, usually tracked
							for at least 30 years, are considered its climate.
